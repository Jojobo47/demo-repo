Demo for using GIthub

Should've started using it a long time ago. I need to fix my issues with avoiding things which I am unfamiliar with. That and add 'fear of failure' to the mix and I have one way ticket to black hole state of mind. 
For now, my main goal is to progress and have non-zero days. Build a habit of being productive and not shying away from tasks.
